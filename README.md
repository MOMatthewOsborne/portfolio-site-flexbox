# portfolio-site-flexbox
A portfolio website

This project was to build a website incorporating CSS flexbox. It needed to be responsive to different screen sizes. The site is to display a number of applications and to act as a portfolio.

# Challenges 
The main challenge was the image grid and how it related to media queries. 
 
 
# Things I learned

I learned a lot about responsive design and flexbox. This was the first time I have built a site using these features. Also, I thought a lot about the layout in general. I also thought a lot about in which order to build certain parts of the site. 

Here are two screenshots of the application.
